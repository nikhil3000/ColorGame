		JAVASCRIPT COLOR GAME

This is a very easy to play Color Game made purely with vanilla JS.
The way you play it is you are given an rgb value, and depending on
the mode you choose you will be displayed a number of squares. You
have to correctly guess which square it is by the rgb value. This
is not my original creation and was made as a part of Colt Steele's
